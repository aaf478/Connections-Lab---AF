        Americans are subject to mandatory and voluntary money exchange. Through taxes, we fund wars we are not even fighting. Lotteries have us gamble away our hard-earned dollars in hopes to break free from systems that cyclically wrong us. The low and middle classes are subject to invest in international wars or our own improbable futures while the real winners are the institutions and corporations designing the system.
